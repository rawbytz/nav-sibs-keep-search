## WorkFlowy Navigate Siblings Keep Search
- Duplicates WorkFlowy's navigate siblings shortcuts _(Alt+Shft+9/0)_ to:
  - _PgDn_ = Zoom to next sibling
  - _PgUp_ = Zoom to previous sibling
- Unlike WorkFlowy's shortcuts, this script makes search criteria persist as you navigate.
- This overrides the default *PgUp/PgDn* functionality!
